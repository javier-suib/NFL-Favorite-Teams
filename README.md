A brief analysis of the NFL favorite teams

In this brief but significant project, he seeks to analyze the behavior of the NFL teams that were favorites in each of their games. The central question that seeks to answer is what is the effectiveness of the favorite teams in the games. As a result, some graphs were obtained that show their behavior, both by team, the predominant result in the matches, as well as by year of the most winning favorite teams. The database was obtained from the kaggle.com website, which is made up of 12 variables and just over 10,700 observations, which are the games of the 1966 NFL season through the first week of 2022.

The code is composed of three parts. The first consists of cleaning the base, a second is the construction of the variables that allow us to observe the behavior of the favorite teams in the games, and the final part is the resulting graphs.
